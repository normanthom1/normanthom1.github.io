# Intro

Welcome to my personal website! I'm Tom Norman, a passionate Senior Data Scientist with a deep love for geospatial analysis, data science, and technology. My journey began in geography, which naturally evolved into a career where I now blend my technical skills with creative problem-solving. Whether it's developing data-driven applications, leading complex analytics projects, or mentoring others, I thrive on the challenges that come with turning raw data into actionable insights. I take a people-first, empathetic approach to my work, ensuring that I not only provide accurate data solutions but also truly understand and meet the needs of my customers, delivering results that make a meaningful impact.

# Some history

- I was born in 1990 in Wellington, New Zealand.
- I went to Island Bay Primary School, South Wellington Intermediate School and then Rongotai College.
- I had parents that loved the outdoors so as a child I was lucky enough to go on hikes, camping trips, and lots of mountain bike rides.
- In 2008 I finished high school, unsure what my next steps would be I worked in a cafe for 8 months to save up money to go overseas.
- In August 2009 Once I had saved up enough money I left for London as fresh faced 18 year old, on a two year working holiday visa.
- After a couple of months seaching in London, I finally got a job at sacred cafe
- One of my big goals going overseas was to learn a new language. I settled on Spanish partly due to hearing about all of my dads travels around South America when he was in his twenties. I took off to Granada for 2 month spanish course.
- Spanish was tough at first. At my langauge school I was put in a class full of Europeans who were learning their 3rd or 4th language. I couldn't keep up with my European class mats but eventually made some progress and then it was time to head back to London.
- Moving back to London I found a Spanish speaking flat, where I was fortunate enought to meet a lovely Argentian and Colombian that patiently let me speak my broken Spanish.
- I worked for a year in London, saved up, and then enrolled in another spanish course, this time it was in a beautiful university town to the North of Spain. 
- In Salamanca I spent six months studying a spanish course at the Univerity.
- I returned back to London and was back working at the cafe. I got tickets back to New Zealand with a detour through Colombia, where I had an amazing time travelling round and linking up with some good Colombian friends that I meant in London. I then had a week in Argentina before I arrived in New Zealand.
- After three long gap years it was time to start University. Unsure what I wanted to study I picked up geography, statistics and marketing. I settled on a Bachelor of Science with a major in development studies and a minor in statistics.
- In my second year of University I signed up for a year's exchange in Colombia, EAFIT University, in Medellin. I took all my papers in Spanish, which was a struggle but great to get to the other side. While I was in Colombia, on exchange, I met my future wife and mother of my two children.
- 2014 - I arrived back in New Zealand and finished the final year of my degree. Discovering an unlikely (or likely) love for GIS. It had the perfect mix of puzzles and technical challenges, with maps and geographies. I also picked up an internship with Land Information New Zealand.
- 2015 - My wife arrived in New Zealand and I enrolled in a postgraduate diploma in GIS.
- 2016 - I finished my postgraduate diploma in GIS and started working at the Ministry for Primary Industries.
- 2018 - I travelled back to Medellin and got married. Lucky to have friends from school come along and peform a beautiful haka.
- 2019 - My son Emilio was born.
- 2020 - I started a new job at the Ministry or Social Development.
- 2021 - My daughter Sofia was born.
- 2022 - We took our little ones to meet their Colombia family for the first time, where we spent two months with my wifes parents.



- At 20, I co-authored a grant to build a satellite and managed a 60+ person team for the next two years. You can read more about that [here](https://ubnl.space/glados/).
